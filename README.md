# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

## What is Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones. 
The sequence typically starts with 0 and 1

## About the program
This Python script generates the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence. 
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

## How It Works

The script defines a function `fibonacci(n)` that generates a list containing the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence. 
It starts with the numbers 0 and 1, and each subsequent number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two.
